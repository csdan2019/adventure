  "longDesc": "This is the upstairs hallway. When you come down from the attic and face the stairs you will be facing south. On your right, or the westward wall, is your parent's bedroom. You're not supposed to go in there. Across the hallway from their room is your room, your sanctuary, if you will. On that same east wall, next to your bedroom is the main bathroom the three of you share. Someone left all of the dog's stuff on the floor (it was you). There's a big red ball by the door to your room, a leash that's about to fall down the stairs, treats scattered everywhere. (Why hasn't the dog eaten them yet? Where is he?) There a recycling bin overflowing with seltzer cans on the wall between your room and the bathroom, thanks to your family-wide flavored seltzer addiction.  Your mom left her purse sitting next to the bedroom door! Maybe there's a key or something in there. If only you could get inside.",
  "shortDesc": "You are in the upstairs hallway. The ladder to the attic is hanging open above you, your parents' room is on the west wall, your room and the bathroom are on the east wall, the stairs are to the south. There is a recycling bin on the east wall, dog toys and treats throughout the hallway, and your mother has left her purse."
