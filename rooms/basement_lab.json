On the northern wall, in the corner to the east, there is a laundry chute which opens up to a laundry basket. You cannot climb up it, but you can slide down it if you know where the entrance is. There is a desk on the south wall, with a computer and a big, old fashioned, keyboard. You need a password to access the computer. The computer has the software for the shrink gun. ",
